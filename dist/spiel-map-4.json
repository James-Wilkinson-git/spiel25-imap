Diese beiden Spiele bilden den Grundstein, um so die Reihe als Jahrhundertreihe fÃ¼r den deutschsprachigen Raum zu verÃ¶ffentlichen.Dieses Jahr geht unsere gemeinsame Reise der Jahrhundertreihe mit zwei Neuerscheinungen direkt weiter!1906 San Francisco: Deine PlanungskÃ¼nste sind gefragt, da du den Einwohnern San Franciscos beim Wiederaufbau mit Tatkraft und Innovationskunst zur Seite stehen musst. Erwerbe BauplÃ¤tze, entferne Schutt, errichte HÃ¤user und entwickle die Stadtinfrastruktur. Durch den einzigartigen Aktionsmechanismus und die dynamische Zugfolge gleicht kein Spiel dem anderen. Mit deiner Hilfe erwacht die Stadt zu neuem Leben.1923 Cotton Club: Leite deinen eigenen Jazzclub und stelle unter Beweis, dass du ein HÃ¤ndchen fÃ¼r gute GeschÃ¤fte zu Zeiten der Prohibition hast. Sichere deinen Club durch Partner in der kriminellen Welt, beschaffe geschmuggelten Alkohol und engagiere herausragende KÃ¼nstler, um die einflussreichsten BerÃ¼hmtheiten der Zeit willkommen zu heiÃen. Jazz war noch nie so spielerisch!Die Jahrhundertreihe zeichnet sich dadurch aus, dass historische Ereignisse aus dem 20. Jahrhundert thematisch, spielerisch und gestalterisch geschickt miteinander verknÃ¼pft werden, um fÃ¼r ein mitreiÃendes und immersives Spielerlebnis zu sorgen. Sowohl die Spielmechaniken als auch die herausragenden Illustrationen von Pedro Soto unterstreichen das Thema und versetzen einen als Spieler direkt an den Ort des Geschehens.Begleite uns auf unserer Reise in andere Welten und Zeiten.

      "description": "Thomas Denkmeier (Austria)What makes D&D special:Dominate & Delegate is inspired by Command & Conquer. A game I played back in the 90s and still play passionately on the PC. Surprisingly, it is the first implementation of the PC game. Of course, according to the agreement with EA Inc, I had to change all forms, pictures, logos and names. My board game is not designed for a large mass of customers to generate high profits. Like many of my projects (e.g. \"Katakis\" music video, \"Die MaschinenstÃ¼rmer\"-LARP and my carnival costumes and parades) D&D is a pure fan project to realize myself and to share my enthusiasm with like-minded people. Even as a child I felt the urge to share enthusiasms. A good example: I remember that at that time it was impossible for me to watch the first time \"Star Wars\" all alone. On the other hand, I always felt the urge to imitate something I was enthusiastic about. In my childhood these were the following examples: Building Star Wars spaceships with LEGO. My carnival costume at the age of 12 as \"Boush\". And the 2 arcade games \"1943\" and \"Thunder Cross\" using the gamemaker SEUCK on the C64 and Amiga.Dominate & Delegate is designed as a 0-business. So, my goal is to share my passion as much as possible and not to make any financial losses.Characteristics regarding the game mechanics:Reviewers reported that the game rules are designed to reflect the video game as best as possible. As a result, the rules are coherent and easy to remember, even though they are a relatively large amount of textual material.In a skirmish (a symmetrical battle 1-3PL), there is no typical strategic recipe to win. Rather, it doesn't matter what kind of strategy you choose, each is threatening to your opponent and could lead to victory.The battle system, while very tactical, is quick to play. There is also no activation token / health point fiddling around. This has the advantage, if in large-scale battles many figures are set up or 4 players exist, each of the players does not have to wait long until it is his turn again.The content of the box is extremely extensive. It consists of 272 plastic faction figures in 4 different colors. There are many modular base plates for outdoor and indoor setups in addition to the large 560 x 560 game board.Extensive 2PL campaign with 39 missions, many ramifications, many secrets and high replay value.Special 1PL Camapign.Extensive tactical options and mechanics: pinch tactics, resource mining, base building, secret production, stealth units, artillery, air units, transport units, super weapon, water units, reward cards, energy management, infiltrators/Capturers, Fog of War, bridges, walls and civilian buildings.Both outdoor missions and indoor missions.",
