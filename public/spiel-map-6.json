During their summer trip in 2022, they tackled the famous West Highland Way, a 100-mile hiking trail that starts in Glasgow and ends in the Scottish Highlands. The beauty of Loch Lomond left an indelible mark on them and in a traditional inn by the lake, they came up with the idea of creating a card game that would capture the wild landscape and legendary stories surrounding the mystic Loch Lomond. Thatâs how their first successful game, Monsters of Loch Lomond, came to life.Four Suit Studio is also present with a mission to make great card games accessible to anyone, anywhere. All our games can be played with a standard deck of playing cards. Bringing the strategic depth and thematic immersion of modern board games.",
