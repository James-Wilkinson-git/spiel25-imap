Our founder, Donald Reents, began his journey in 1980 with his gaming store, Games of Berkeley. &nbsp;Don fueled his passion for games by making gaming accessories with Berkeley Game Company in 1981. Don transitioned into distribution with Berkeley Game Distributors in 1982 and then manufacturing in 1984. Chessex Manufacturing officially began making dice starting in 1987. &nbsp;Don is always thinking of new and innovative features to add to his dice. For example, Chessex was the first company to manufacture d4s with the numbers on the top point area of the die instead of the bottom edge. The Chessex Tens10â¢ die shape was designed independently at the same time as Lou Zocchiâs style of percentile d10. Chessex also replaced the dots next to the 6s and 9s and instead used an underline to indicate their orientation. Don is known for pioneering your favorite dice color styles such as SpeckledÂ®, ScarabÂ®, BorealisÂ®, GeminiÂ®, NebulaÂ®, and many more.Today, Chessex is still motivated by our founding mission: to make high-quality dice that are affordable for all gamers, because you can never have too many dice!&nbsp;As Donald once said, âI didnât get into this business to make a lot of money; I simply did it because I liked games. Itâs all because of you that I made Chessex, and it has become what it is today.â&nbsp;",

In 2023 we decided to start our own studio and publish some of our concepts. Our games are made with love and passion in the hopes to share some of this with other gamers around the world.Our first product, Those Who Dare - The Stone To Space Age RPG, is an historic fiction TTRPG. Play your own fictional character in any era of human history, or itâs future. You choose when and where you want to play, or use our end-to-end storytelling to visit the descendents of one group down through the ages, or be time-hoppers jumping from age to age. The choice is yours!We will also have playable demos of our two new games coming soon. Nothing Left (But To Cry) is a party card game that invites you to laugh at the existential dread of every day life. Do your best to cope as life throws crisis after crisis at you, untill there is nothing left, but to cry. Miskatonic High is our next TTRPG, using the same Daring System we built for Those Who Dare. Take on the role of highschoolers at a finishing school attached to H.P. Lovecraftâs famous Miskatonic University. You arenât the A-team, you arenât even graduates. But as you navigate your school and social life you and your friends will realise that when eldritch horrors are coming for your school, you will have to step up!",
