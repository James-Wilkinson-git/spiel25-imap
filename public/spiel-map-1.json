Space Breachers is a thrilling cooperative board game for 1â5 players, where you command a squad of elite soldiers infiltrating a massive enemy spaceship. Battle swarms of monstrous foes through a maze of corridors as you race to complete critical mission objectives. The game unfolds on a dynamic, procedurally generated board that represents the ever-shifting layout of the spaceship. Enemies emerge in waves of mysterious âblips,â revealed only when a Breacher makes contact. A blip could be anything from a crazed, lowly sailor to a terrifyingly powerful Hellnaughtâkeep your rifle loaded and your wits sharp when you breach that next door!  ",
