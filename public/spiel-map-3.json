This game finally developed into Materia Prima.Behind Peacock Tabletops is the philosophy that the design and mechanisms of a game should be as one. Everything superfluous is eliminated, so that in the end only the essence of a game idea remains. For this reason I design the game mechanisms parallel to the design of the individual game components in order to guarantee an optimal game experience at the end.By the way, thanks to my studies of fine arts I am able to design all game components with pencil, brush and paint.
