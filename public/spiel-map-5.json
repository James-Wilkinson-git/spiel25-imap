      "description": "Blue Donut Games Ltd. is a UK based games designer and publisher.We design and develop our own range of tabletop games. We are also developing video games.Iâve spent over twenty years developing systems. From computer systems for multi-media to B2B and retail e-commerce working out the logic flow for some pretty wacky pricing and discounting structures. Some of the oldest names in games making and publishing have used systems I had to work out! Before that I worked in storyboarding, graphic art, comics, T.V Commercials and so on. So I have a good technical and creative background.It was a very talented young game designer called Adam Carter-Groves who first introduced me to developing card games six years ago. We developed together Line The Skateboard Card Game, Immortal Paths and Devices. He is now a senior games designer at the legendary UK Games Studio, Team17. Adam taught me loads about games, but the best thing was that he inspired me to not just try to get a game out at a show but create a dedicated business to the tabletop industry.Working as a designer myself, I have created the tile-based card collecting game called Horror in the Library. This is my first solo game, which was rather ambitious, but it was one of those game ideas that would keep one awake at night. I have had a lot of help from my fantastic team to get it turned it to a coherent, well thought, and beautiful game.Working in boardgames is a labour of love. You wonât get rich and itâs expensive. Iâve invested a lot of time and money doing it but itâs such fun. Weâve got off to an amazing start and weâre grateful for all the support weâve had from other industry partners, publishers, designers and customers. Our customers are invaluable. The people we meet at UK Games Expo and Spiel have been an amazing support. We value their knowledge as many are veteran players and a few have created their own games. Itâs been very humbling when well known designers have visited us and played our games then given us feedback.There is an awesome amount of camaraderie between fellow creators. They share advice and encouragement. Itâs unusual in what really is a very crowded marketplace. There is always room for another designer and publisher.The last year has been very hard for everyone in the world. The Board Game industry has had a tough time and we have lost a lot of small creators for the moment. So we are very, very thankful that we have survived and that we are part of a group of companies that have worked hard to support this endeavour.",

Beginning in 2011, our company cooperated with Ms Maureen Hiron, the famous creator of many globally best-selling games who is now greatly. The first game we released under the Stragoo brand was Continuo, produced in our factory in Czechia, followed quickly by Grabolo, Grabolo Junior and Tripolo, whose production was eventually moved to China. We participated in their design from the beginning, which sold well all over Europe. Ms Hiron was incredibly enthusiastic and convinced her other business partners to produce games in cooperation with us using our original concepts and designs. We continued to work closely with Ms Hiron until her passing in 2022, not only in the visual form of the games, but also in consultation about game variants and possibilities. We own several European and worldwide licenses for her other games, such as Colo-Rolo, SneakPeak, Catz-Ratz-Batz and others. Under the Stragoo brand we also pusblish games by other authors that fit into the concept of fast perception games packed in a tin box. Our major clients include companies in Hungary, Spain, Portugal, Germany, Korea, Israel, Italy, poland, the Netherlands, Scandinavia and now in Ukraine and France as well.Under the Stragoo brand, a number of new games were created in the original packaging - a round tin box and a plastic cards inside, which for the most part came from the world-famous game author Maureen Hiron. These are fast-paced, reflex games with simple rules that entertain not only children of different ages, but also their parents, which is their undeniable advantage.The bestsellers of this edition is Grabolo Junior, Tripolo and SneakPeak, which are exported to many European countries (eg.Spain, Hungary, France) and beyond (eg. South Korea).",
